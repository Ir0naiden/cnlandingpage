# CN Landing Page

Part of our codenation course was to experiment with CSS animations and construct a kind of landing page using the codenation logo and links. 

This currently hasn't been optimised for devices, as it wasn't part of the task, so best viewed on a desktop screen.

I chose to use only use HTML & CSS, no Javascript was used.
